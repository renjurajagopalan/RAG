It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.ython relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
